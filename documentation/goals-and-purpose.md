## LSSh purpose and vision
### LSSh’s purpose

The purpose of LSSh is to create a flexible solution for secondhand sales through both a web application and easily accessible premises. The range of products, prices, opening hours and location will be adapted to students and their needs in order to lay the foundation for a circular use of students' furniture and to give inspiration for a more sustainable lifestyle.

### LSSh’s vision

Our vision is to establish LSSh as a given part of Linköping University. In doing so, we want to move away from our wear-and-tear society and contribute to a more circular consumption, which will minimize the students' environmental impact. This is done by inspiring to adapt a sustainable lifestyle and making secondhand sales easier, as well as spreading the concept. Beyond being the alternative to throwing furniture away, we want to create a positive feeling about recycling and make students see the value of our resources.

## Background for web application project

A central part of the purpose of LSSh is to create a flexible solution for secondhand sales through a web application or web application and easily accessible premises. The current webapplication is made with a software called “Sharepoint” which is accessed through the IT-service LISAM and can only be accessed by current students at Linköping University. The current web application present a few problem areas which will serve as the background for this new web application project, these are presented below.

### Lack of usability

Usability is the measurement of how well a user can achieve a certain goal effective, efficiently and satisfactorily. The current web application is very hard to be accessed without a link (Which can be found in LSSh social media or navitas.se). The current web application offers several other problems which is slow loading time, not intuitive product catalog and confusing buttons and cluttered with too much text and information.

### Lack of modern and trustworthy design

Design is a subjective measure, but the current web design is not very modern if compared to other web application and web application which sell or present products online. Research in trustworthiness on the web show that two important factors are good structural and graphical design. Examples of this is not having a confusing design, easy to read and concise text, good first impression, pictures that cover a lot of the page etc. The current web application does not achieve this well and is lacking a trustworthy design.

### A lot of manual work and lack of database approach

Currently administration of the current web application and inventory list of the items in the shop is completely separated from each other. This means that changes must be made in several places which are completely independent of each other. This results in potential user errors, a lot of manual work and a more difficult administration process.

## Goals and purpose for the web application project

The general purpose of this web application project is to replace the current web solution with a improved web application tailored to LiU Student Secondhands needs. For this to be a viable solution the web application needs to be easy to further develop in the future since LSSh operations may change, thus requiring good documentation and well tested code.

  

Furthermore, the web application shall be delivered as a finished product which an administrator without coding knowledge shall be able to use to run LiU Student Secondhands operations.

  

There are also some specific goals that we want to achieve, and all of these goals follow the SMART model for setting good and achievable goals. Each goal are supposed to be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound.

### Goal 1 - Usability

The web application shall at least by the end of September (2020) have a SUS-test usability score of at least 80.3/100 points resulting in a A for all users (Students, workers, administrators).

### Goal 2 - Web application design

#### Goal 2.1 Trustworthy and professional

The design of the web application shall at least by the end of September (2020) based on quantitative answers from Likert questions be perceived as professional and trustworthy for student users.

#### Goal 2.2 - Graphical profile

The design shall at least by the end of September (2020) based on quantitative answers from Likert question be perceived connected to Navitas graphical profile.

#### Goal 2.3 - Responsive design

The design shall at least by the end of September (2020) have a tested good responsive design throughout the entire web application at least for the student user and with ease be used for phones, tablets and desktop.

### Goal 3 - Database approach

The web application shall at least by the end of September (2020) use a database approach for all data stored.

  

Problems with not using a database approach:

  

• Redundancy: multiple copies

• Inconsistency: independent updates

• Inaccuracy: concurrent updates

• Incompatibility: multiple formats

• Insecurity: proliferation

• Inauditability: poor chain of responsibility

• Inflexibility: changes are difficult to apply

  

### Goal 4 - Administrator and shop workers

The web application shall at least by the end of September (2020) have the possibility to easily administer all places on the web application which are mentioned in the specification. The shop worker should only be able to administrate the product catalog and products.

### Goal 5 - Documentation

The web application shall at least by the end of September (2020) have all the required documentation for new developers and active members of LSSh to easily get an understanding of the web application. For developers it should be easy with the documentation to understand and further develop the web application.

### Goal 6 - Testing of code (Not design)

The web application shall at least by the end of September (2020) have been tested thoroughly with e.g. functions and all required tests shall be approved according to each test.
