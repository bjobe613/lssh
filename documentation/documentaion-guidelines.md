For the purpose of developing, managing and maintaining the system many documents will be created and used during and after this project. The documents must thus be accessible, readable and easy to use for current and future developers and maintainers. To reach these goals we set the following guidelines to help keep the documentation as homogenous and structured as possible. The document created during the development of LSSH web application should follow the guidelines listed below. 

### General:
* The documentation shall be written in English.
* Formal language shall be used.
* Much detail shall be given for ease of use.
* All documentation shall be written with Markdown-syntax.
* Documentation shall be stored to the same Git repository as the code, but in a separate and designated folder.

### All documents must contain the following information:
* Name of author(s).
* Date of creation.
* Date of latest change.
* Topic in the header.
* Purpose or short description of the document or itâ€™s content.

Aside from the above set guidelines one can structure the document to fit the purpose. Keep in mind that others may depend on this documentation. Be thorough and structured.
