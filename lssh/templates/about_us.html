                <p>A problem was identified: a time-gap between students selling furniture and new students needing to buy furniture, 
                    this gap leads to furniture in good condition being thrown away. We try to bridge this gap by providing storage for the furniture, 
                    thereby making it possible for students to sell their furniture after they have moved away when new student have arrived.</p>

                <p> In 2019 a project group was put together to start up a Secondhand as a part of the sustainability association Navitas. 
                    The university could provide a location there by making a non-profit secondhand store possible. After many months of working, 
                    LiU Student Secondhand was launched and opened to students in December 2019. </p>
